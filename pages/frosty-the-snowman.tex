\begin{verse}
Frosty the Snowman\\
Was a Jolly happy soul\\
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose\\
And two eyes made out of coal\\!

Frosty the Snowman\\
Is a fairytale they say\\
He was made of snow, but the children know\\
How he came to life one day\\!

There must have been some magic\\
In that old top hat they found\\
For when they placed it on his head\\
He began to dance around\\!

Oh, Frosty the Snowman\\
Was alive as he could be\\
And the children say he could laugh and play\\
Just the same as you and me\\!

Frosty the Snowman\\
Was a Jolly happy soul\\
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose\\
And two eyes made out of coal\\!

Frosty the Snowman\\
A fairytale they say\\
Was made of snow\\
But he came to life one day\\!

There must have been some magic\\
In that old top hat they found\\
For when they placed it on his head\\
He began to dance around\\!

Frosty the Snowman\\
Knew the sun was hot that day\\
So he said, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun\\
Now before I melt away"\\!

Frosty the Snowman\\
Had to hurry on his way\\
But he waved good-bye, saying, "Don't you cry\\
I'll be back again some day!"\\!
