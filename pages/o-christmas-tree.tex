How lovely are your branches!

How lovely are your branches!

Not only green in summer’s heat,
But also winter’s snow and sleet.

How lovely are your branches!

Of all the trees most lovely;

O Christmas Tree, O Christmas tree,
Of all the trees most lovely.

Each year you bring to us delight
With brightly shining Christmas light!
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas tree,

Of all the trees most lovely.
