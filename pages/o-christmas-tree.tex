O Christmas Tree, O Christmas tree,\\
How lovely are your branches!\\
O Christmas Tree, O Christmas tree,\\
How lovely are your branches!\\
Not only green in summer’s heat,\\
But also winter’s snow and sleet.\\
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,\\
How lovely are your branches!\\!

With brightly shining Christmas light!\\*

Give hope and strength throughout the year.\\

We learn from all your beauty.\\!
