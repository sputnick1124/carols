City sidewalks, busy sidewalks. Strings of street lights

Dressed in holiday style Even stop lights

In the air Blink a bright red and green
There's a feeling As the shoppers rush

of Christmas home with their treasures

Children laughing

People passing Hear the snow crunch

Meeting smile after smile See the kids bunch

and on every street corner you'll hear This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle

Silver bells, silver bells You'll hear

It's Christmas time in the city

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing Silver bells, silver bells

Soon it will be Christmas day It's Christmas time in the city

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day
