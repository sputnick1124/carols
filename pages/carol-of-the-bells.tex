\settowidth{\versewidth}{Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Hark! How the bells, sweet silver bells\\
All seem to say, "Throw cares away"\\
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer\\
To young and old, meek and the bold\\!

Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song\\
With joyful ring, all caroling\\
One seems to hear, words of good cheer\\
From everywhere, filling the air\\
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound\\!

O'er hill and dale, telling their tale\\
Gaily they ring, while people sing\\
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here\\!

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas\\
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas\\
On-on they send, on without end\\
Their joyful tone to every home\\!

\textit{Repeat x1}\\!
\end{verse}
