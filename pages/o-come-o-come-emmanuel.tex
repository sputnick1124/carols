\begin{verse}
O come, O come, Emmanuel,\\
And ransom captive Israel;\\
That mourns in lonely exile here,\\
Until the Son of God appear.\\
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel\\
Shall come to thee, O Israel.\\!

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free\\*
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;\\*
From depths of hell Thy people save,\\*
And give them victory o'er the grave.\\*
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel\\*
Shall come to thee, O Israel.\\!

O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer,\\
Our Spirits by Thine Advent here;\\
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,\\
And death's dark shadows put to flight.\\
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel\\
Shall come to thee, O Israel.\\!
