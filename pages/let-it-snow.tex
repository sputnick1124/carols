\begin{verse}
Oh the weather outside is frightful\\
But the fire is so delightful\\
And since we've no place to go\\
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow\\!

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping\\
And I've brought me some corn for popping\\
The lights are turned way down low\\
Let it snow, let it snow\\!

When we finally kiss goodnight\\
How I'll hate going out in the storm\\
But if you'll really hold me tight\\
All the way home I'll be warm\\!

And the fire is slowly dying\\
And, my dear, we're still goodbying\\
But as long as you love me so\\
Let it snow, let it snow and snow\\!

When we finally kiss goodnight\\
How I'll hate going out in the storm\\
But if you really grab me tight\\
All the way home I'll be warm\\!

Oh the fire is slowly dying\\
And, my dear, we're still goodbying\\
But as long as you love me so\\
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow\\!
