\begin{verse}
Here we come a-wassailing\\
Among the leaves so green;\\
here we come a-wand'ring\\
so fair to be seen.\\!

Refrain:\\
\textit{
Love and joy come to you,\\
and to you your wassail too;\\
and God bless you and send you a happy New Year,\\
and God send you a happy New Year.\\!
}

We are not daily beggars\\
that beg from door to door;\\
but we are neighbours' children,\\
whom you have seen before.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!

Call up the butler of this house,\\
put on his golden ring.\\
Let him bring us up a glass of beer,\\
and better we shall sing.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!

Bring us out a table\\
and spread it with a cloth;\\
bring us out a mouldy cheese,\\
and some of your Christmas loaf.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!

God bless the master of this house\\
likewise the mistress too,\\
and all the little children\\
that round the table go.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!
