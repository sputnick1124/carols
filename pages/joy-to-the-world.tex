\begin{verse}
Joy to the world, the Lord is come\\
Let Earth receive her King!\\
Let ev'ry heart prepare Him room\\
And Heaven and nature sing\\
And Heaven and nature sing\\
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing\\!

Rejoice! Rejoice when Jesus reigns,\\
And Saints their songs employ\\
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains\\
Repeat the sounding joy,\\
Repeat the sounding joy,\\
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy\\!

No more will sin and sorrow grow,\\
Nor thorns infest the ground;\\
He’ll come and make the blessings flow\\
Far as the curse was found,\\
Far as the curse was found,\\
Far as, far as the curse was found.\\!

Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,\\
While Israel spreads abroad\\
Like stars that glitter in the sky,\\
And ever worship God,\\
And ever worship God,\\
And ever, and ever worship God.\\!
