1 We three kings of Orient are; 3 Frankincense to offer have |;

bearing gifts we traverse afar, incense owns a Deity nigh;

field and fountain, moor and mountain, prayer and praising, voices raising,
following yonder star. worshiping God on high. [Refrain]
Refrain: 4 Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume

O star of wonder, star of light, breathes a life of gathering gloom;

star with royal beauty bright, sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
westward leading, still proceeding, sealed in the stone-cold tomb. [Refrain]

guide us to thy perfect light.

5 Glorious now behold him arise;

2 Born a King on Bethlehem's plain, King and God and sacrifice:
gold | bring to crown him again, Alleluia, Alleluia,
King forever, ceasing never, sounds through the earth and skies. [Refrain]

over us all to reign. [Refrain]
