\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{verse}
The holly and the ivy,\\
When they are both full grown,\\
Of all the trees that are in the wood,\\
The holly bears the crown.\\!

Refrain:\\
\textit{
The rising of the sun\\
And the running of the deer,\\
The playing of the merry organ,\\
Sweet singing in the choir.\\!
}

The holly bears a blossom,\\
As white as the lily flower,\\
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,\\
To be our sweet Saviour.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!

The holly bears a berry,\\
As red as any blood,\\
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ\\
For to do us sinners good.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!

The holly bears a prickle,\\
As sharp as any thorn,\\
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ\\
On Christmas Day in the morn.\\
\textit{Refrain}\\!
