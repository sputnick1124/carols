\begin{verse}
Bring a torch, Jeanette, Isabella,\\
Bring a torch, to the cradle run!\\
It is Jesus, good folk of the village;\\
Christ is born and Mary's calling:\\
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Mother!\\
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is Her Son!\\!

Who is that, knocking on the door?\\
Who is it, knocking like that?\\
Open up, we've arranged on a platter\\
Lovely cakes that we have brought here\\
Knock! Knock! Open the door for us!\\
Knock! Knock! Let's celebrate!\\!

It is wrong when the Child is sleeping,\\
It is wrong to talk so loud!\\
Silence, all, as you gather around,\\
Lest your noise should waken Jesus:\\
Hush! Hush! See how fast He slumbers;\\
Hush! Hush! See how fast He sleeps!\\!

Softly to the little stable,\\
Softly for a moment come;\\
Look and see how charming is Jesus,\\
How He is white, His cheeks are rosy!\\
Hush! Hush! See how the Child is sleeping;\\
Hush! Hush! See how He smiles in dreams!\\!
