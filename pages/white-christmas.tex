I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones | used to know
Where the treetops glisten

And children listen

To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card | write

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones | used to know
Where the treetops glisten

And children listen

To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card | write

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
