\begin{verse}
God rest ye merry gentlemen\\
Let nothing you dismay\\
For Jesus Christ our Saviour\\
Was born on Christmas Day\\
To save us all from Satan's pow'r\\
When we were gone astray\\
O tidings of comfort and joy\\
Comfort and joy\\
O tidings of comfort and joy\\!

From God our Heavenly Father\\
A blessed Angel came;\\
And unto certain shepherds\\
Brought tidings of the same,\\
How that in Bethlehem was born\\
The Son of God by Name.\\
O tidings of comfort and joy,\\
Comfort and joy\\
O tidings of comfort and joy\\!

The shepherds at those tidings\\
Rejoiced much in mind,\\
And left their flocks a-feeding\\
In tempest, storm and wind,\\
And went to Bethlehem straightway\\
The Son of God to find.\\
O tidings of comfort and joy,\\
Comfort and joy\\
O tidings of comfort and joy\\!

But when to Bethlehem they came,\\
Whereat this infant lay,\\
They found Him in a manger,\\
Where oxen feed on hay;\\
His Mother Mary kneeling down,\\
Unto the Lord did pray.\\
O tidings of comfort and joy,\\
Comfort and joy\\
O tidings of comfort and joy\\!

Now to the Lord sing praises,\\
All you within this place,\\
And with true love and brotherhood\\
Each other now embrace;\\
This holy tide of Christmas\\
All other doth efface.\\
O tidings of comfort and joy,\\
Comfort and joy\\
O tidings of comfort and joy.\\!
