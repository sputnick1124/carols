Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, Later on, we'll conspire,

In the lane, snow is glistening As we dream by the fire

A beautiful sight, To face unafraid,

We're happy tonight, The plans that we've made,

Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird, In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Here to stay is a new bird And pretend that he's a circus clown

He sings a love song, We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
As we go along, Until the other kids knock him down.

Walking in a winter wonderland.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,

In the meadow we can build a snowman, Though your nose gets a chilling
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
He'll say: Are you married? Walking in a winter wonderland.

We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job * Walking in a winter wonderland,

When you're in town. Walking in a winter wonderland.
